This is a 2D minigame creating for the University of Maryland Game Development Club.

The club was hosting a game jam where members would end up creating a game in the style of Warioware, where each team
    creates a game, using arrow keys, WASD, and the spacebar as the entire control system.
The product attached was developed in less than 24 hours, with me creating the sprites and the scripts. A partner of mine
    provided the background music for the game, although they do not have a GitHub account associated with the project.
My minigame was inspired by the likes of Disney's Dance Dance Revolution, and arcade games where arrows are moving down
    the screen, and the player has to press/step on a button corresponding to the arrows in time to score points.
I decided to create a scoring system similar to Golf or Hearts, where points are bad, and points are given based on the distance between the arrow moving down the screen and the outline which indicates when the player is supposed to press the correct arrow key. If the player exceeds a certain value of points, they lose the game.
